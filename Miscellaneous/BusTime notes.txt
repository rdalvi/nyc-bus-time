OneBusAway seems not useful - only has static information (e.g., locations of bus stops). No real time info


Can use SIRI StopMonitoring


- Call StopMonitoring to get a single MonitoredVehicleJourney
- Look inside the MVJ to get the departure time in ISO8601 format
- Convert from ISO8601 to human readable time
